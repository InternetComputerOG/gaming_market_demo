# .gitignore Context

## Overview
Standard .gitignore file for Python projects, excluding build artifacts, caches, environment files, logs, and IDE-specific files to maintain clean version control. Ensures sensitive data like .env and temporary outputs (e.g., plots, exports) are not committed, aligning with demo-scale robustness per Implementation Plan section 10.

## Key Exports/Interfaces
- No code exports; static text file with ignore patterns grouped by categories (e.g., # Python, # Environment).
- Patterns include: *.pyc, __pycache__/, .env, .idea/, *.log, .pytest_cache/, *.png (for Matplotlib), htmlcov/.

## Dependencies/Imports
- No imports or dependencies; standalone file.
- Interacts with: All project files by defining what Git ignores during commits.

## Usage Notes
- Copy standard Python template and customize for demo specifics (e.g., ignore Streamlit caches, Matplotlib outputs, test coverage).
- Essential for security (excludes .env with Supabase keys) and cleanliness; apply at repo root.

## Edge Cases/Invariants
- Invariants: Always include .env and __pycache__/ to prevent leaks/cruft.
- Edge cases: Handle OS-specific files (e.g., .DS_Store); no impact on code execution or tests.
