# LOB Update Checklist: Implementing True Limit Price Enforcement

## Overview

This checklist outlines the specific updates required to implement **Option 1: True Limit Price Enforcement** throughout the Gaming Market Demo codebase, based on the recent updates to the [Gaming Market TDD.md](./Gaming%20Market%20TDD.md).

## TDD Changes Summary

The following key changes were made to the TDD that must be implemented:

### 1. Cross-Matching Mechanics (Lines 160-169)
- **NEW REQUIREMENT**: Users pay/receive exactly their limit prices
- **NEW REQUIREMENT**: Trading fees applied separately and transparently  
- **NEW REQUIREMENT**: Limit orders execute at-or-better than specified prices
- **NEW REQUIREMENT**: Mathematical proof of solvency preservation under this model

### 2. Pseudocode Updates (Lines 256-272)
- **FIXED**: Fee calculation formula: `f_match * (price_yes + price_no) / 2`
- **FIXED**: System collateral calculation: `V_i += (price_yes + price_no) * fill - fee_cross`
- **NEW**: Detailed comments explaining true limit price enforcement
- **NEW**: Clarification that YES buyers pay their limit price, NO sellers receive their limit price

### 3. New User Experience Section (Lines 439-466)
- **NEW SECTION**: Comprehensive explanation of limit order pricing model
- **NEW**: Fee structure with split fees between maker/taker
- **NEW**: User experience benefits and mathematical properties
- **NEW**: Clear documentation of solvency preservation and overround maintenance

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Core Engine Updates

#### 1.1 Update `app/engine/lob_matching.py`

  - [x] Update fee calculation to use correct formula: `f_match * (price_yes + price_no) / 2` 
  - [x] Fix V update to use: `V_i += (price_yes + price_no) * fill - fee` 
  - [x] Add detailed comments explaining true limit price enforcement 
  - [x] Ensure cross-matching only occurs when `price_yes + price_no >= 1 + f_match * (price_yes + price_no) / 2` 

- [x] **Update `match_market_order` function**:
  - [x] Ensure market orders respect limit price semantics when matching against LOB 
  - [x] Apply proper fee calculation for LOB matches

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Changes

2. **Integration tests**: Ensure proper interaction between components  
3. **End-to-end tests**: Validate complete user workflows
4. **Load testing**: Ensure performance under realistic conditions

### Rollback Plan
1. **Version control**: Tag current working state before changes
2. **Feature flags**: Implement toggles for new LOB behavior if needed
3. **Database migrations**: Ensure reversible schema changes
4. **Monitoring**: Add metrics to detect issues early
